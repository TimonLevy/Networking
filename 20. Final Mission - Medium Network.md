# MEDIUM (SOMEWHAT SECURE) NETWORK

This is my medium (somewhat secure) Network, so what is it made up of:
 
**Servers**: Mail, DNS, DHCP, Web, SQL, Files, Domain Controller.<br>
**Security/Management systems**: Siem (Arcsight), SNMP, McAfee EPO, Snort, Workstations.<br>
**Workstations**: 6 Linux, 6 Windows.<br>
**DMZ Servers**: Files, Web, DNS, NTP.

| Secure                                                                                	| Unsecure                                                                                                    	|
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| The only access to the network through the internet is possible through a VPN server. 	| The DC is put in a segment with servers that could be vulnurable.                                           	|
| The network has a SIEM deployed, McAfee EPO server and a Snort IPS on the FW.         	| Some segments are connected using switches and not routers. Making them valnurable to some layer 2 attacks. 	|
| There is a separate segment for management workstations.                              	| There is a snort IPS on the central FW of the network, making it susceptible to denial of service attacks.  	|
| The network is split into segments which allow better managemnt of ACLs on the FW.    	|                                                                                                             	|
    
```diff
- (There are things missing from the network such as SIEM an IDS/IPS...)
+ I added them.
- (There is more to the network in terms of secure and not secure, one example is the DC should be in its own segment please sit and look at it again and make two colums for secure and not secure and fill them again pay more attention this time)
```
