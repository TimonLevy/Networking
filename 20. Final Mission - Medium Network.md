# MEDIUM (SOMEWHAT SECURE) NETWORK

This is my medium (somewhat secure) Network, so what is it made up of:
 
**Servers**: Mail, DNS, DHCP, Web, SQL, Files, Domain Controller.
**Security/Management systems**: Siem (Arcsight), SNMP, McAfee EPO, Snort, Workstations.
**Workstations**: 6 Linux, 6 Windows.
**DMZ Servers**: Files, Web, DNS, NTP.


    
```diff
- (There are things missing from the network such as SIEM an IDS/IPS...)
+ I added them.
- (There is more to the network in terms of secure and not secure, one example is the DC should be in its own segment please sit and look at it again and make two colums for secure and not secure and fill them again pay more attention this time)
```
