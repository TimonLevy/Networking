<div id="TlsStart">
Both TLS and SSL are protocols used to encrypt information on the wire in a way that both endpoints can decrypt them. That is why they belong in the `Session Layer`. Nowadays TLS is the standard for session encryption and regarded as the better protocol, originally TLS was born from SSL 3.0 and superseeded it.

<p class="inset">SSL 1.0 -> SSL 2.0 -> SSL 3.0 -> TLS 1.0 -> TLS 1.1 -> TLS 1.2 -> TLS 1.3</p>

<h3>WHY WERE THEY INVENTED</h3>
At the time, communication on the internet was transmitted cleartext, which posed great dangers to it's users. So in the year 1995 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Netscape</a> introduced this protocol to serve protection to the communication by encrypting the packet's contents when it travels.

<h3>HOW DO THEY WORK</h3>
The SSL & TLS protocols are made up of 4 sub-protocols, each responsible for another part of the process:

    </tr>
    <tr style="height:13px">

        <td>
            <a href="#TlsRecord">↗</a>

        <td>This is the protocol that encrypts, compresses and ecapsulates the application data.</td>

<h3>Handshake Protocol</h3>
<b><label>STEP 1: CLIENT HELLO</label></b>
The client initiates the connection with the server, in this initiation he sends data that will be used later on like: supported version, random number, cipher suites, compression algorithms and more.

<b><label>STEP 2: SERVER HELLO</label></b>
[HELLO] The server chooses all the best compatible options and sends them back to the client. The server may also choose to apply already existing security parameters in this stage.
[CERTIFICATE] The server sends it's <a href="github.com/TimonLevy/Networking/blob/main/Extras.md#what-are-ssltls-certificates">certificate</a> to validates it's authenticity and give the client it's public key.
[DONE] This message means it finished it's [HELLO]. (There may be more messages between the [DONE] and the [CERTIFICATE])
     
<b><label>STEP 3: CLIENT KEY EXCHANGE</label></b>
The client will begin initiating a key exchange that will create session keys. The exchange algorithm is defined by the cipher suite that the server chose in the [SERVER HELLO] message. <text style="color:brown">In TLS the keys can not be calculated by anyone else other than the client and server since at least one parameter in the formula will be a secret. That is what's called a `pre-master secret`.</text>
<sup>A huge exploit was found in SSL that allowed attackers to extract the server's private key and possibly find out the key. SSL 3.0 was the first version to support Diffie-Hellman Key exchange, prior to that only RSA was allowed.</sup>

<b><label>STEP 4: FINISH</label></b>
[CHANGE CIPHER SPECIFICATIONS] In this step the client sends a message telling the server to update it's connection's state and start encrypting messages.
[FINISHED] The client will send a [FINISHED] message that is already encrypted. 

The server will send those two messages as well and the encrypted session will be established.

<h3>Change Cipher Spec Protocol</h3>
This protocol is made up of a single byte with the value of "1", it's meant to tell the recipient to update CipherSpec immediately (Cipher Specifications: keys, Algorithms, etc.). This message will be encrypted by the current connection's CipherSpecs.
</div>
<div id="TlsHandshake1.3">
<h3>Handshake Protocol (TLS 1.3)</h3>
TLS saw a big revision in the handshake process, one that made it way less viable for attacks, quicker and kept `Perfect Forward Secrecy`.

<b><label>STEP 1: CLIENT HELLO</label></b>
Since the protocol only allows perfect forward secrecy compatible ciphers, a `key share` value (or values) is sent to the server as well. That's the value it needs in order to generate the key.

<b><label>STEP 2: SERVER HELLO</label></b>
The server will pick a cipher, calculate the `client key` using the client's `key share`. Then it creates a new `key share` of it's own and sends that and the chosen cipher to the client.

After this message the connection will be encrypted. The server will then send a certificate to validate itself and a finished message to let the client know it's done. Using the server's `key share` the client can `generate the server's symmetric key` and decrypt the messages from the server.

* The client will send messages encrypted with it's client key and decrypt messages from the server using the server's key.
* The server will send messages encrypted with it's server key and decrypt messages from the client using the client's key.

Another feature TLS version 1.3 provides, is the ability to send a client hello message together with the first byte of data already encrypted! This is called a 0-RTT handshake.

<div id="TlsAlert">
<h3>Alert Protocol</h3>
This protocol will alert the recipient in case of an error or warning, the alerts are labeled by level of severity. 
<sup>In the case of a fatal severity the connection is immediately terminated and the session nullified, to not let a new connection use the same parameters and potentially repeat the error.</sup>
</div>
<div id="TlsRecord">
<h3>Record Prtocol</h3>
The record protocol is responsible for the encryption of the message, the validation of message integrity, fragmantation and the compression. It does that using the current CipherSpecs which will include the encryption algorithms, keys, compression algorithms and <a href="github.com/TimonLevy/Networking/blob/main/Extras.md#message-authentication-codes">MAC algorithms</a>. It does all that by fragmenting the message and compressesing the fragments. Then each fragment is appended it's MAC. Finally, the fragments are encrypted, appended and a Record protocol header is added.
<sup>* TLS uses a different MAC lgorithm called HMAC, essentially it hashes the message to make it more compact but still representative of the original message.</sup>

<diff>
- (Is the only purpose of the protocol is to create ecryption keys to symetrically encrypt the connection?)
- (Stratesd checking this protocol but you wrote W-A-Y too much information summaries it)
