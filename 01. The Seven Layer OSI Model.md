## **The Seven Layer Model of OSI**

### **BRIEF HISTORY**

Computers nowadays are used all over the world, and the way they are connected is through the internet. Basically, a web of connections made up by all the machines in the world. However, it was not always like that...

Back in the 80s, computers used to communicate on their own dedicated networks, the format they used to transfer information with one another was different in each computer brand and that made communicating in-between them very difficult.

In order to solve that, a standard was proposed. It was delivered in 1984 and called the **OSI Model**. (The OSI model was updated in 1994 and it is the one we use today)

### **OVERVIEW**

The model is made up of 7 layers, each layer addressing a different aspect of networking and solving a problem that arises in that aspect. When a machine sends a network packet, it is then wrapped in the different layers according to the needs in a process called **encapsulation** and those are peeled off on the receiving machine by a process called **decapsulation**. (The first layer is not included in the _encapsulation_)

To better illustrate what I mean, I will take the classic example of sending a letter and represent that using the OSI model:

### **THE LAYERS**

#### <font size=4>Uno, Physical</font>
> The first layer of the OSI model is the layer including the components used to simple transfer the data from one machine to another, that includes:
> 
> *   **Hubs**
> *   **Network cables**
> *   **Repeaters**
> *   **Wi-Fi**

<br>

#### <font size=4>Dos, Data-Link</font>

> The second layer of the OSI model is used to give an addressing scheme for computers that are connected physically to eachother, that is done using a networking component called a `switch` and the addressing scheme is called `MAC` which stands for "Media Access Control".

Every computer connected to the network has a **NIC**, a Network Interface Card, which has a `MAC Addresses`. A MAC Address is a standard, "one of a kind", string of 12 Hexadecimal characters (exmple: A0-B1-C2-D3-E4-F5). We can use that MAC Address to send information to another machine on the same network.

Another component in the 2nd layer is a `Switch`. A switch connects multiple computers physically using network cables to a hub which theh creates a *local* network called "**LAN**" (Local Area Network). [Oh my god! WOW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H46FRRvb-9o). A switch can be used to create multiple smaller LANs called **VLAN**s (V - virtual) that are isolated from the rest of the LANs.

The switch is responsible to forward the packet's to the approiate recipeints based on MAC addresses in the Layer 2 header. Layer 2 is also includes a Cyclic Redundency Check, which is an integrity check for the data.

#### <font size=4>Tres, Networking</font>

> The third OSI layer's duty is enabling delivery of packet from one machine to another in the internet, unlike layer 2 which focuses on the LAN. It has it's own seperate addressing scheme and networking component.

The third layer serves the purpose of **End to End** packet delivery, by using a different addressing scheme then the one that layer 2 uses called `IP address`. An IP Address is made up of 32 bits represented as 4 octets, each 0-255 (example: 100.4.120.77). That address is used to find and deliver packets to machines in the internet. 

This layer's component is the `Router`, which acts as a transport node (but also a standalone component) in the internet. _Routing_ packets from one **endpoint** (not neighbor) to another using their IP addresses. A process called **End to End** delivery.


**So why use both MAC and IP addressing?**

They serve different purposes.<br>
L3 IP addresses are used to address the two peers in the conversation and will stay static for the entirety of that session. L2 MAC addresses will change each time the packet arrives at a new NIC to get to the next NIC using their MAC address (hop by hop).

They are used by differnt components.<br>
A router will know which router to send the packet to next based on the ip address, a NIC will know which NIC to send to next based on the MAC address (which will be of the next router in the route).

They are used in different ways.<br>
The same IP address will be used the entire route, a different MAC address will be used each new node.



```diff

+ Your rephrase was used. <3
- (MAC and IP does not serve the same purpose exactly, and please rephrase and simplify your explanation about the differences)
+ And the diffrences were simplified.

#### <font size=4>Cuatro, Transport</font>

> The 4th layer's job is providing transport protocols that enable: service to service delivery and reliable transmission. This is done using the TCP, UDP, QUIC and more protocols, these are the fundaumental protocol used to communicate between machines. Questions that this layer answers are "How to send data reliably?", "How to send data to a specific application?" and "How to maintain a session between two computers?".

The goal of the 4th layer, the transport layer, is to provide **Service to Service** communication. Basically, what application or service gets what piece of data? we wouldn't want our minecraft game to be sent discord messages.

The way layer 4 sorts the incoming `data streams` by application is by using another addressing scheme called `logical ports`(similar to physical ports). There are also differnt `transport protocols`, here are the two being mainly used:<br>

**TCP** <font size=1>(Transmission Control Protocol)</font>
> This protocol is used to transmit information over a stable connection between two endpoints (favors reliability). has 65535 ports.
>     
> [+] TCP Handshake.<br>
> [+] Data-Loss recovery.<br>
> [+] Flow control.<br>
> 
> [-] Slower than UDP (Higher Round trip time).<br>
> [-] Expensive to initiate.<br>


**UDP** <font size=1>(User Datagram Protocol)</font>
> This protocol is used to send data without a pre-established connection very quickly and inexpensively (favors efficiency). has 65535 ports.
> 
> [+] Very fast.<br>
> [+] Very simple.<br>
> [+] 0 RTT.<br>
> 
> [-] Not stable.<br>
> [-] No data-loss recovery.<br>
> [-] No Flow control.<br>

<br><br>

An application that wants to communicate over the network can bind itself to a vacated port using one of the protocols that layer 4 has (TCP and UDP ports are differnt). Then any data that gets sent to that logical port will be interpreted by that program. Each time a computer get's a packet it will direct the data to the application responsible to the port indicated in the layer 4 header.

```diff
- (In which way does the addressing scheme called `transport protocols & ports` is similar to ports on a switch?)
+ I am stoopid.
- (In the diagram the data should be under layer 2 not above 4)
+ Got rid of the diagrams.
```

#### <font size=4>Cinco, Session</font>

> The session layer is simply responsible for the connectivity of the session. It creates, terminates and manages network sessions.

Layer 5 just manages the session of the two endpoints:
* creating it at the beginning of communication 
* termintating it at the end of communication.
* Re-establish transport connection if it fails.
* Efficient diconnection handling using "checkpoints".
* Multiplex data across multiple transport connections. (HTTP 2.0 / HTTPS / QUIC)

```diff
- (please rephrase the first sentence between the **. Couldn't understand the sentence)
+ Done :3
```
<br>

#### <font size=4>Seis, Presentation</font>

> The presentation layer is responsible for encoding and compression of data and most importantly encryption algorithms.

The 6th layer is crucial, it is responsible for preparing the data to be ready for processing by the application layer. It's responsible for encrypting the data using encryption protocols, character set translation and data compression. Machines may use different encoding so this layer is responsible for encoding/decoding the information, if the two machines want to encrypt their sessions then this layer is also responsible for that. From the actual message encryption to establishing encryption algorithms and keys. And lastly this layer is responsible for compressing the data to improve efficiency.

#### <font size=4>Siete, Application</font>

> The application layer contains application specific protocols that involve user input or output, it is actually the only layer that interacts with the user. A protocol that can be found in this layer is HTTP or SMTP.
