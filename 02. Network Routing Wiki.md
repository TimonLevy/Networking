# HOW PACKETS GET THROUGH THE NETWORK

Computers on the network communicate by sending each other messages containing data, this data is then used by the computers to perform certein tasks. But how do these messages know where to go? Network devices and addresses.

Network devices are devices that are used to get messages from one machine to another inside of a network, all the computers in the network are connected. Depending on the size and configuration of the network a different device will be needed. A device will be able to communicate to another device using two different addresses: IP and MAC. A MAC address is a unique address to that device only, and IP address is a higher layer address that tells the device where the machine is. Basicaly MAC address means "Who am I?" and an IP address means "Where am I?".

### <font size=6>Switch</font>
The switch is a device on the 2nd OSI layer. It's use is to forward packets based on MAC addresses. When multiple machines are connected to the switch, they create what's known as a *Local Area Network*. All the machines in the *LAN* are then able to communicate using each other's MAC addresses. Machines connect to the switch using a physical slot in the switch called a 'physical port', meaning they need to be close to eachother (hence "local area").

The switch maps the **physical port to MAC address** translation in a memory cache called the **MAC Table**. It uses the MAC table to forward the packets to the correct recipients.

Machines can also send messages to all the connected machines, using a dedicated MAC address called **broadcast**. (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF)

### <font size=6>Router</font>
The router is a device on the 3rd OSI layer. It's use is to route packets based on IP addresses. When multiple switches are connected to a router they create a *Wide Area Network*, also a WAN. Machines can also independently connect to the router. In order to connect a LAN to the internet it needs to have a router connected to it physically.

Each network has an address, (like a street name), the router maps all the network addresses to the physical connection on a **Routing Table**. It then uses those *routes* in order to forawrd packet in-between LANs. Routers also have an ip address of their own and may connect to other routers in order to connect more networks together.

### <font size=6>Default Gateway</font>

A router, acting as the gateway in and out of the network. Machines inside the network will send it packets for routing when the recipient isn't a part of the network. And it will also route messages in the same way.

### <font size=6>ARP - Address Resolution Protocol</font>

ARP is a network protocol meant to resolve IP addresses into MAC addresses and vice versa. It does that by asking the entire network who owns that particular IP address and then asks them for their MAC address. Afterwards the asking machine will save the solution in a local cache called the **ARP Table**.

Alright, after we got that let's see what will happen in the situation where PC1 wants to send a message to PC3. Reminder: PC1 has to know PC3's IP address.

> PC1 knows that PC3 is not in their own network by compairing the net id in their IP addresses. It will try to send the ICMP packet to thr router but it doesn't know it's MAC address. PC1 will send an ARP query in the network, getting a response from R1.<br>
(In that transaction that switch will learn both PC1 and R1's MAC addresses and bind their MAC addresses to their physical ports)

> PC1 sends the message to R1, R1 knows that LAN `10.0.1.x` is connected through the other port and attempts to routes it there.

> R1 doesn't know what PC3's MAC address is so it sends an ARP query. PC3 will return a response. The switch S2 will learn and bind their MAC addresses.

> The router will send the message to PC3 using the newly found MAC address.

> If PC3 wants to return a response, it will send a message with PC1's IP address and R1's MAC address (it learnt it in from the ARP inquiry). The Router knows PC1's MAC address and it will send it to PC1.
