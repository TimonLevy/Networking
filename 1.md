## **The Seven Layer Model of OSI**

### **BRIEF HISTORY**

Computers nowadays are used all over the world, and the way they are connected is through the internet. Basically, a web of connections made up by all the machines in the world. However, it was not always like that...

Back in the 80s, computers used to communicate on their own dedicated networks, the format they used to transfer information with one another was different in each computer brand and that made communicating in-between them very difficult.

In order to solve that, a standard was proposed. It was delivered in 1984 and called the **OSI Model**. (The OSI model was updated in 1994 and it is the one we use today)

### **OVERVIEW**

The model is made up of 7 layers, each layer addressing a different aspect of networking and solving a problem that arises in that aspect. When a machine sends a network packet, it is then wrapped in the different layers according to the needs in a process called **encapsulation** and those are peeled off on the receiving machine by a process called **decapsulation**. (The first layer is not included in the _encapsulation_)

To better illustrate what I mean, I will take the classic example of sending a letter and represent that using the OSI model:

### **THE LAYERS**




#### **The First Layer, The Physical layer**

The physical layer isn't really a layer, it is also not involved in the encapsulation process. The Physical layer just consists of standards to physical networking components, like:

*   **Hubs**
*   **Network cables**
*   **Repeaters**
*   **Wi-Fi**

Simply put, the physical layer is just the components and wires that get the bits of information from point **A** to point **B** (Over a short geographic distance).




#### **The Second Layer, The Data-Link Layer**

The Data-Link layer solves the issues presented when sending information between physically connected computers. It serves the purpose of sending bits of information from one **NIC to another NIC**. A `NIC`: Network Interface Cards (Could also be a **Wi-Fi Access Card**), is a physical component in a machine that receives the information from the cable and into the machine.

**Each NIC** has a `MAC Addresses`. A `MAC Address` is a standard, "one of a kind", string of 48 bits represented by 12 _Hexadecimal_ characters (exmpl: A0-B1-C2-D3-E4-F5) that are exclusive to each NIC. We can then use that `MAC Address` to send information to another machine on the same network.

Another component in the 2nd layer is a `Switch`. A switch allows to connect multiple computers physically using network cables to creating a *local* network called "**LAN**"* (Local Area Network). A switch can also be used to group computers in the LAN to *sub*-networks called a "**VLAN**"s* that are "pseudo-isolated" from the rest of the computers connected to the switch, sending packets from one VLAN to another is still possible tough.

The 2nd layer also takes care of delivering a packet through routers using MAC Addresses, simply delivering to the next router **NIC MAC Address** until the target machine is reached.
This way of packet delivery is called **Hop-to-Hop**.


> LAN - A network of physically connected machines, limited by the need for cables and switches.
> 
> VLAN - A group of computers bound together in a switch port configuration under the same vlan tag that separates them from the rest of the computers/groups in the LAN.

            [C1] ---------- [R0] ---------- [R1] ---------- [R2] ---------- [C2]
            ====`o                                                          ====`o

```

#### **The Third Layer, The Networking Layer**

The third layer serves the purpose of **End to End** packet delivery, by using a different addressing scheme then the one that layer 2 uses called `IP address`. An `IP Address` is made up of 32 bits represented as 4 octets, each 0-255. 

A component used that belongs to this layer is the `Router`, the router lets computers communicate outside of their networks in-directly, passing the packets though themselves and routing them to their end goal one router at a time.

```
             __             !__             !__             !__              __
            [C1] ---------- [R0] ---------- [R1] ---------- [R2] ---------- [C2]
            ====`o                                                          ====`o
MAC ADDR    a0-d2-e0        f0-d1-f2        a2-2f-3f        5f-2c-4d        a0-d2-e1
IP  ADDR    192.130.200.1                                                   192.130.44.21
```
**So why use both MAC and IP addressing?**
The simple answer is that they serve the same purpose in different methods that rely on eachother. Like we know, the 2nd layer work on a *hop by hop* system and the 3rd layer works on an *end to end* system. The IP address signifies the address of the end computer while the MAC address can be used to route the packet.

STEPS TO MOVE YOUR PACKET! (FROM C1 TO C2)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1.  Packet after leaving C1, on it's eay to the first router (R0).

    +---------------------------------------+
    |   DATA                                |
    |   011001010110000101110011011101000   |
    |   110010101110010                     |   
    +---------------------------------------+
    | SENDER IP ADDRESS     192.130.200.1   |
    | TARGET IP ADDRESS     192.130.44.21   |
    +---------------------------------------+
    | SENDER MAC ADDRESS    a0-d2-e0...     |
    | TARGET MAC ADDRESS    f0-d1-f2...     |
    +---------------------------------------+

    2.  Packet reaches R0 successfully, the router strips the layer 2 header.
        The router then attaches it's own layer 2 header to route the packet
        to the next router.

    +---------------------------------------+
    |   DATA                                |
    |   010001010110011101100111            |
    +---------------------------------------+
    | SENDER IP ADDRESS     192.130.200.1   |
    | TARGET IP ADDRESS     192.130.44.21   |
    +---------------------------------------+
    | SENDER MAC ADDRESS    f0-d1-f2...     |
    | TARGET MAC ADDRESS    a2-2f-3f...     |
    +---------------------------------------+

    And so it goes until the packet reaches IP address 192.130.44.21.
