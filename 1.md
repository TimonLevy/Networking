# The Seven Layer Model of OSI

### BRIEF HISTORY
Computers nowadays are used all over the world, and the way they are connected is through the internet. basically, a web of connections made up by all the machines in the world. However it was not always like that...

Back in the 80s, computers used to communicate on their own dedicated networks, the format they used to transfer information with one another was different in each computer brand and that made communicating in-between them very difficult.

So in order to solve that a standard was proposed, which was then delivered in 1984 called the **OSI Model**. (The OSI model was updated in 1994 and it is the one we use today)

### OVERVIEW
The model is made up of 7 layers, each layer addressing a different aspect of networking and solves a problem that arises in that aspect. When a machine send s network packet, it is then wrapped in the different layers according to the needs in a process called **encapsulation** and those are peeled off in the receiving machine by a process called **decapsulation**. (The first layer is not included in the *encapsulation*)

To better illustrate what I mean here I will take the classic example of sending a letter and represent that using the OSI model:

### THE LAYERS

#### The First Layer, The Physical layer
The physical layer isn't really a layer, it is also not involved in the encapsulation process. The Physical layer just consists of the various in-Lan physical components of the network, like:
* **NICs** (**N**etwork **I**nterface **C**ards)
* **Hubs**
* **Network cable standards**

Simply put, the physical layer is just the components and wires that get the signal from point **A** to point **B** locally (Over a short geographic distance).

#### The Second Layer, The Data-Link Layer
The Data-Link layer involves more networking and
