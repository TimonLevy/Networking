## ICMP

ICMP, or **I**nternet **C**ontrol **M**essage **P**rotocol is what it says in it's name. It is used to send control messages relating to the Internet protocol (IP).

Since the implementation of IP is not meant to be absolutely reliable and it can sometimes mess up, The ICMP protocol be used to return send feedback about problems that can arise when communicatinf with a host. However the ICMP protocl does not act to make the IP more reliable and does not guarantee 100% reliablility itself incase IP fails.
