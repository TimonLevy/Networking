# N.etwork A.ddress T.ranslation

Network Address Translation, or NAT for short, is a solution proposed to preserve the amount of IPv4 addresses in use. When IPv4 was first introduced it was unexpected that the internet and the use of IP addresses will grow to this magnitude.

There are 4,294,967,296 IPv4 addresses, but that is not nearly enough. So engineers devised a way to save them, by using public and private IPv4 addresses.

> Public IPv4 address, a reistered public ip that is necessary to connect to the internet.

> Private IPv4 address, an unregistered IP address to be used in your home network by the different machine.

However, if the devices in your home use private IP addresses and it is said that a public IP address is necessary to connect to the internet.. How will they do that exactly? You may choose to pay more money to your ISP (Internet Service Provider) and register public IPs for your devices but that would be a waste of money and IP addresses.

Instead, You can register only one IP address for your gateway to the internet, and then let it translate every private ip that goes through it to the single public IP address that it has. It work in reverse as well, NAT can translate public to private addresses.

## How does it do that?

The main goal is to translate a private IP address to a public IP address. Introducing the NAT table, it is a table to keep track of translations between private and public IP addresses, so when a packet with a private IP address gets to the router it will know what public address to use. And more importantly when a packet with the public ip arrives at the router it will know what machine to route it to.

There are multiple ways to translate addresses:

> **Static NAT**
>
> In this translation the network administrator has to set the NAT tables by hand, mapping which address translates to which address including tcp ports.<br>
> This method will be used for machines that have a static IP and need to be accessed from outside the network using a single consistent IP, like web servers.

> **Dynamic NAT**
>
> In this translation, the router will have a pool of more than one public addresses (which have to be bought). Afterwards, the router will translate one private IP address to one public IP address until all IP addresses in the pool are used. When there are no IPs left to use the local machines will have to wait for an address to become free.<br>
> This method will be used when we have a set of machines that we know how many of them need to be connected to the internet at a certein point in time.

> **Static PAT / Port Forwarding / NAT Overload**
>
> In this translation, a singe public IP address is translated to a single private IP address however specific IP and port combinations can be translated to other specific private IP and port combinations. Like:
> 
> | Private____________________ | Public_______________________ |
> | ----                        | ----                          |
> | 10.0.1.1                    | 192.168.142.22                |
> | 10.0.1.25:80                | 192.168.142.22:80             |
>
> This method is used when there are a big amount of machines and we want to allow them all access to the internet using only a single IP address. It is a really popular method for NAT because it is conservative.

```diff
- (When would you use each one of the methode of NAT?)
+ Static - will be used for machines that have a static IP and need to be accessed from outside the network using a single consistent IP, like web servers.
+ Dynamic - will be used when we have a set of machines that we know how many of them need to be connected to the internet at a certein point in time.
+ PAT - is used when there are a big amount of machines and we want to allow them all access to the internet using only a single IP address.
```

## Encouters with NAT in the wild

Today the use of NAT is widespread due to the need of IP address conservation. As attackers on the internet we will only have access to the public addresses of the networks we will want to attack, which will most likely not have sensitive information on the other side. So how do we access the private network?

1. **Slipstream attack**
> In 2020 a valnurability was found in the interpretation of the ALG layer of TCP packets on routers. The weakness allowed attackers to access any service on the victim machine if he connected to them on http to port 5060.<br>
> Later a new variant of this attack was found that allowed the access of any service on **any machine** in the private network through the slipstreaming.

2. **EtherOops**
A valnurability found on weak ethernet cables that allows sending packets in packet than when error-handled get treated as brand new packets. 

```diff
- (How will the port scan help? Try again)
+ Added 2 attacks.
