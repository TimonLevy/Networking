# INSTRUSION AND PREVENTION DETECTION SYSTEM

## IDS - Intrusion Detection System
An intrusion Detection System is a network component that looks into network traffic and, based on certein methods, alerts when it detects malicious traffic.<br>
It will usually be applied on a central network device like the firewall since you want to filter as much data as possible, but any device that can supports it can be an IDS.

```diff
- (Is it a must to put it in a central location?)
+ No, it can be implemented anywhere in the network. But it is favorable to put it in a more central location in the network to make it able to analyze as much traffic as it can.
```

### NIDS - Network-vased Intrustion Detection System
A Network-based IDS can apply different methods in order to detect malicious activity:
- **Signatures** The IDS will sign each packet and compare them to a database of malicious packet signatures, this kind of detection can alert of valnurability exploitation of certein network protocol. This method may be applied online (real time) or offline (analyzing pcaps or other stored packet data). A fault with this sytem is that it wont be able to recognize new attacks.
- **Anomalies** Using neural network it can analyze the behavior of the network and detect most attackes by catching discrepancies from a set baseline network activity. Neural Networks can also learn from past mistakes which makes it a really useful method of detection. This detection method is prone to produce a lot of false-positives.
- **Policy** An IDS policy is a stand-alone set of rules that determines wether a networking sessions is allowed or not. It is standalone but can omply with other existing policies (like Firewall, Router and more.)

### HIDS - Host-based Intrustion Detection System
A Host-based IDS detects discrepancies and anomalies in the host, it looks in the Operating System and possibly even network interfaces. It operates very similarly to the NIDS.<br>
It works by looking at verious points of interest at the system leve:
- System & Security Logs.
- Valuable Files list.
- Network Interace Card.
- Processes.
- Memory.
- File Metadata.

There are a lot of ways it operates in:
- **Sinatures** The HIDS will have a list of valuable system objects (like files, registry keys and such) to monitor, it will remember each objects attributes and also hash the file. Then it can monitor these system objects and see if any changes have been made.
- **Memory** HIDS can look at certein regions in memory and alert if they have been changed.
- **Logs** HIDS can look at various end point logs and alert of any suspicious activity, like bruteforce attacks.

## IPS - Intrusion Prevention System

Intrusion Prevention System operated like ID Systems however they will take action instead of just alerting the SIEM. Basically they are a superset of of ID Systems, providing more functionality.

### NIPS - Network Instursion Prevention System

Sniffs the packets that flow through it and has the ability to stop the flow of certein packets if it detects any foul play, NIP Systems follow rules and policies that are set beforehand. The same ones that serve the ID Systems.

### HIPS - Host Intrusion Prevention System

Sniff that passes to the local machine, it has the ability to drop certein packets like ones that are flagged by the ruleset as malicious. Usually the HIPS will inspect the packets first, before the local firewall.

## Snort - An IDS/IPS Product

Snort is an IDS/IPS system (depending on how it is configured), Snort operates based on a rule set that has a very specific format:

### Rule Types
The basic rule is written as a line following this format:
`action protocol/service src_ip src_port -> dst_ip dst_port (options)`

There is also a **Service specific** rule that goes like:
`action service (options)`

Snort can process **Files** that are sent on the following services:
* http, smtp, pop3, imap, smb & ftp
The format goes like this:
`action file (options)` (This rule will apply to all files)
OR
`action protocol(NOT SERVICE) src_ip src_Port -> dst_ip dst_port (options)` (This rule will apply to specific file transfers)

Another rule type that takes advantage of the file processing capabilities of Snort is the **File Identification** rule type, it is used to label files based on traits it can discern from it's contents. These labels are then used in later rules.

The format goes as follows:
`file_id(options)`

### Actions
The first segment of the rule is the action that should be taken when a packet matching the rule is met, the types are:
* **alert** - generates an alert.
* **block** - block the current packet and all following packets in the flow.
* **drop** - drop the current packet.
* **log** - log the current packet.
* **pass** - mark the current packet.
* **react** - send response to the client and terminate the session.
* **reject** - terminate the session with a TCP reset packet or an ICMP unreachable response.
* **rewrite** - rewrites contents in the packet based on the "replace" option in the rule.

### Protocol
This segment tells the rule was protocol to look for. The supported ones in Snort3 are:
* ip
* icmp
* tcp
* udp

There is also the options to list services, which are:
* dns
* ftp
* http
* sip
* smtp
* sql
* ssh
* telnet
* ssl
* S7
* mms
* DCE/RPC

### IP addresses
Could be written as:
* "any"
* a single string IP with the option of a CIDR block (10.0.0.1 / 10.0.0.0/24)
* a variable from the snort.conf file ($HOME_NET)
* an ip address list ([10.0.0.1,10.0.1.0/24,192.168.100.1])

### Port Numbers
Could be written as:
* "any"
* Static number (80)
* variable from the conf file. ($HTTP_PORTS)
* port range (1:1024)
* List of static ports ([80,443,8000:9000,$HTTP_PORTS])
Ports can be negated using the ! operator, and important to notice is that if a rule matches the service of the packet but not the port number the rule will still apply!

### Direction Operators
There are two valid operators:
* `->` - Tells the system to look at packets where the src and dst ips match the ones on the packet.
* `<>` - Tells the system that the src and dst ips and ports could be either on the sniffed packets.

### Options
The options of the rule are the main componenets of it, making the decision if to take the `action` rather than detecting the packet. Options are split into 4 categories:
* General options
* Payload options
* Non-payload options
* Post-detection options

The options within these rules are linked to in the bullets but I will list some common ones:
* **msg** - sets a message to be printed when the rule is matched.
* **sid + rev** - **sid** sets an id for the rule so it can be easily identified. **rev** means revision, allowing easy management and editing of rules. Two rules can have the same sid as long as their revision is different. (Snort reserves all the sids up to 1000000)
* **priority** - sets a priority value for use when prioritizing events.
