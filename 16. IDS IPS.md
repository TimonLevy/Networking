# IDS - Intrusion Detection System

An intrusion Detection System is a network component that looks into network traffic and, based on certein methods, alerts when it detects malicious traffic.

An intrusion detection system will usually be applied on a central network device like the firewall since you want to filter as much data as possible, but any device that can supports it can be an IDS.

#### Host and Network Based

Host based IDS is a little different since it does not analyze networ traffic but application and computer logs to detect malicious activity. 

## IPS - Intrusion Prevention System

If an IDS is given the abilty to stop communication that it detects as malicious, it becomes an IPS. IPS' may sometimes get their analyses wrong and block communication on a *false positive*. However when it block malicious traffic as intended it is called a *true positive*.

## Detection

Detections of "intrusions" can be done in different methods, one of them is signing method:

> In the signing method, the packet is digested by some hashing algorithm that outputs a `signature`. This signature is them compared to a database containing hundreds or thousands of signatures of malicious packets.

> Another method for detection is detecting anomalous se of certein protocols and how they deviate from the normal use case of those prtocols.
